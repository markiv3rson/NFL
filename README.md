# NFL SLATEZZZ — private site

Password-gated Next.js site (Vercel) plus a Python model service (Railway, `railway-model-service/`).
Betting venue is Polymarket US only; sportsbook odds (The Odds API) are reference data.

## Layout
- `public/` — the page (index.html + app.js): Game Lines, Totals, Anytime TD, Record tabs
- `pages/api/` — snapshots (Polymarket lines + TD prices, sportsbooks), model rerun proxy, grading, My Bets, status, backup
- `lib/` — shared logic: picks, grading, calibration, My Bets sync, injuries, snap counts, wind
- `middleware.ts` — password gate
- `railway-model-service/` — fair_line.py (game lines), td_prob.py (anytime TD), injury_adj.py, scheduler; see its README

## Data
Redis (Upstash) for all stored data. nflverse for schedule, scores, play-by-play, injuries and snap counts.
Polymarket prices use the actual buy price (best ask).

## Environment variables (Vercel)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL_REDIS_URL, SITE_USERNAME, SITE_PASSWORD, MODEL_SERVICE_URL, ODDS_API_KEY,
POLYMARKET_KEY_ID, POLYMARKET_SECRET_KEY.

## What the numbers mean
- Moneyline win chance: calibrated, uses the market spread as an input; carries real signal.
- Spread / total picks: calibrated; sit near 50% because the model-vs-market gap has no measured signal. Background only.
- Anytime TD chance: td_prob.py, calibrated on two held-out seasons. Record tab grades it against its own stated
  chances and against Polymarket's closing prices.
